# Project Idea: The Big Bang

Particles being sucked into a single point and exploding into planets

## Uniqueness 

This demo will be unique from existing demos of explosions in that it 
will implode using one texture and explode using another. This will not 
be a static object exploding, as in many existing demos, but rather particles 
coming together in order to explode.
